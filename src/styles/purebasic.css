PureBASIC native IDE style ( version 1.1 - November 2016 )

by Tristano Ajmone <tajmone@gmail.com>

Public Domain

	This CSS file diverge from the official one contained in highlight.js package.
	This file as been optimized to highilight PureBASIC syntax ONLY!!
	It also include the "function_call" class, to catch Procedure calls — as is customary
	with PureBASIC IDE syntax coloring — which didn't make it into the official package.

NOTE_1:	PureBASIC code syntax highlighting only applies the following classes:
			.hljs-comment
			.hljs-function
			.hljs-keywords
			.hljs-string
			.hljs-symbol


NOTE_2:	Color names provided in comments were derived using "Name that Color" PureBASIC tool:
			https://github.com/tajmone/name-that-color	

CHANGES:
 v1.1 (2016/11/22):
 	-- Renamed colors names using "Name that Color" PureBASIC, instead of
 	   "Name that Color" online tool — NTC PureBASIC uses the dE00 algorithm for color
 	   difference, which yelds more precise results, and thus different names on some
 	   occasions (here, just "Tradewind" for "Persian Green").
